      <h1>Abstract</h1>
      <p>This report presents a gate-set tomography (GST) analysis of a dataset called %(datasetLabel)s.</p>
    </div>
    
    
    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <section>
      <p>GST characterizes logic operations on a quantum device (e.g., a qubit), by treating it as a black box. This black box is equipped with a small set of “buttons” that apply quantum <em>gates</em> to the quantum system inside. One button initializes it, a second button triggers a 2-outcome measurement, and the remaining buttons perform transformations. We avoid assumptions about the device&apos;s operation whenever possible. Currently, we assume that: </p>

      <ul>
       <li>the quantum device is a qubit (has a Hilbert space of dimension 2),</li>
       <li>each <em>gate</em>, or logic operation, can be represented by a stationary Markov process (a.k.a. “quantum channel”).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The core of GST is an algorithm that takes certain inputs, and produces certain outputs. The <em>input</em> to GST comprises (1) a list of data, and (2) “target” gate set describing the <em>ideal</em> behavior of the device. GST data comprises a list of experiments – each described by the sequence of gates that was applied – and, for each experiment, two integer <em>counts</em> stating how often the “plus” and “minus” results were observed. The target gates are used <em>only</em> to (a) report how consistent the estimates are with the target, and (b) choose the best <em>gauge</em> in which to report the results. GST does not take them into account in its core analysis, and there is no possibility of circularity or other <q>cheating</q>.</p>

      <p>GST&apos;s primary output is an estimated <em>gate set</em> that models or ﬁts the device&apos;s observed behavior. Gate sets are of the form $\{\rho_0,E_0,\{G_k\}\}$, where</p>
      <ul>
	<li> $\rho_0$ is an estimate of the density matrix in which the device gets initialized,</li>
	<li> $\{E_0,1\!\mathrm{l}-E_0\}$ is an estimate of the POVM describing how it gets measured, </li>
	<li> and each of the $G_k$ is an estimate of the superoperator (quantum process) describing the corresponding gate.</li>
      </ul>
